/**
 * SIDJUA — Phase 11c: SSE Event Stream Manager
 *
 * Manages the set of connected SSE clients and routes broadcast events to
 * matching clients. Also provides EventPoller which periodically reads new
 * task_events rows and feeds them into the manager.
 *
 * Memory exhaustion via unbounded SSE connections.
 *   Previously any authenticated caller could open unlimited SSE streams.
 *   Fixed: MAX_CLIENTS=100 hard cap; addClient() returns false when full
 *   (caller should return 503). Cleanup sweep every 30 s removes clients
 *   whose SSEWritable is closed without removeClient() being called.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *  - SSEWritable is a minimal interface over Hono's SSEStreamingApi so that
 *    tests can inject simple mock writables.
 *  - broadcast() ignores write errors (closed streams are cleaned up by the
 *    keep-alive ping loop in the route handler).
