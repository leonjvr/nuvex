## Why SIDJUA?

Every AI agent framework today relies on the same broken assumption: that you
can trust the AI to follow its own rules.

**The problem with prompt-based governance:**

You give an agent a system prompt that says "never access customer PII." The
agent reads the instruction. The agent also reads the user's message asking it
to pull John Smith's payment history. The agent decides — on its own — whether
to comply. That's not governance. That's a strongly worded suggestion.

**SIDJUA is different.**

Governance sits **outside** the agent. Every action goes through a 5-step
pre-action enforcement pipeline **before** it executes. You define rules in
YAML. The system enforces them. The agent never gets to decide whether to
follow them, because the check happens before the agent acts.

This is governance by architecture — not by prompting, not by fine-tuning,
not by hoping.

---

## How It Works

SIDJUA wraps your agents in an external governance layer. The agent's LLM
call never happens until the proposed action clears a 5-stage enforcement
pipeline:

**Stage 1 — Forbidden:** Blocked actions are rejected immediately. No LLM
call, no log entry marked "allowed", no second chances. If the action is on
the forbidden list, it stops here.

**Stage 2 — Approval:** Actions that require human sign-off are held for
approval before execution. The agent waits. The human decides.

**Stage 3 — Budget:** Every task runs against real-time cost limits. Per-task
and per-agent budgets are enforced. When the limit is reached, the task is
cancelled — not flagged, not logged for review, *cancelled*.

**Stage 4 — Classification:** Data crossing division boundaries is checked
against classification rules. A Tier-2 agent cannot access SECRET data. An
agent in Division A cannot read Division B's secrets.

**Stage 5 — Policy:** Custom organizational rules, enforced structurally. API
call frequency limits, output token caps, time-window restrictions.

The entire pipeline runs before any action executes. There is no "log and
review later" mode for governance-critical operations.

### Single Configuration File

Your entire agent organization lives in one `divisions.yaml`:

```yaml
divisions:
  - name: engineering
    agents:
      - name: research-agent
        provider: anthropic
        model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
        tier: 2
        budget:
          per_task_usd: 0.50
          per_month_usd: 50.00
    governance:
      rules:
        - no_external_api_calls: true
        - max_tokens_per_response: 4096
        - require_human_approval: [delete, send_email]
```

`sidjua apply` reads this file and provisions the complete agent infrastructure:
agents, divisions, RBAC, routing, audit tables, secrets paths, and governance
rules — in 10 reproducible steps.

### Agent Architecture

Agents are organized into **divisions** (functional groups) and **tiers**
(trust levels). Tier 1 agents have full autonomy within their governance
envelope. Tier 2 agents require approval for sensitive operations. Tier 3
agents are fully supervised. The tier system is enforced structurally — an
agent cannot self-promote.

## Architecture Constraints

SIDJUA enforces these constraints at the architecture level — agents cannot
disable, bypass, or override governance — it executes outside their runtime,
before their actions:

1. **Governance is external**: The governance layer wraps the agent. The agent
   has no access to governance code, cannot modify rules, and cannot detect
   whether governance is present.

2. **Pre-action, not post-action**: Every action is checked BEFORE execution.
   There is no "log and review later" mode for governance-critical operations.

3. **Structural enforcement**: Rules are enforced by code paths, not by
   prompts or model instructions. An agent cannot "jailbreak" out of
   governance because governance isn't implemented as instructions to the model.

4. **Audit integrity**: The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is integrity-verified.
   Tampered entries are detected via SHA-256 integrity checks.

5. **Division isolation**: Agents in different divisions cannot access each
   other's data, secrets, or communication channels.

## Features

### Governance & Compliance

**Pre-Action Pipeline (Stage 0)** runs before every agent action: Forbidden
check → Human Approval → Budget tracking → Data Classification → Custom
Policy. All five stages are structural — they execute in code, not in the
agent's prompt.

**Mandatory Baseline Rules** ship with every installation: 10 governance rules
(`SYS-SEC-001` through `SYS-GOV-002`) that cannot be removed or weakened by
user configuration. Custom rules extend the baseline; they cannot override it.

**EU AI Act Compliance** — audit trail, classification framework, and approval
workflows map directly to Article 9, 12, and 17 requirements. The August 2026
compliance deadline is built into the product roadmap.

**Compliance Reporting** via `sidjua audit report/violations/agents/export`:
compliance score, per-agent trust scores, violation history, CSV/JSON export
for external auditors or SIEM integration.

**Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** with integrity verification: every governance
decision is written to an integrity-verified log before execution. Tampered
entries are detected via SHA-256 integrity checks on read. `sidjua memory
recover` re-validates and repairs.

### Communication — Multi-Channel

Agents don't just respond to API calls — they participate in real communication
channels. Every inbound message becomes a governed task. Every outbound message
is logged in the audit trail.

| Channel | Status | Features |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Discord** | ✅ Full | Gateway daemon, threads, slash commands |
| **Email** | ✅ Full | IMAP IDLE inbound, SMTP outbound, thread mapping |
| **Telegram** | ✅ Full | Bot API, long-polling, text + files + images |
| **CLI** | ✅ Full | `sidjua chat`, `sidjua run` |
| **REST API** | ✅ Full | POST /api/v1/messages — any external system |
| **WebSocket** | ✅ Full | Real-time for GUI/PWA and custom clients |
| **Slack** | ⚠️ Beta | Socket Mode adapter |
| **WhatsApp** | ⚠️ Beta | Self-hosted via baileys adapter |

**Slash commands** from any platform: `/status`, `/agents`, `/tasks`, `/costs`,
`/budget`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/cancel`, `/schedule`, `/help`, `/divisions`.
Role-based access: viewer (read-only), user (submit tasks), admin (full control).

**Message-to-Task Bridge** — user messages go directly to the agent. Governance
rules are the only firewall. No NLP gatekeeping, no interpretation layer.

**Audited User Override** — when governance blocks a task, users can explicitly
override with a time-limited approval window. Every override is logged with user
ID, timestamp, and original block reason. Critical policies are non-overrideable.

### Autonomous Runtime

Agents run as persistent background daemons — not session-bound, not reactive.

**Always-On Daemons** — `sidjua start` becomes a persistent service
(systemd/Docker). Agents find work without explicit triggers. Configurable
modes: always-on, on-demand, cron-triggered. Daemon-level budget governance:
max cost/hour and max tasks/hour hard limits. Circuit breaker pauses the agent
after repeated failures and alerts the human. Graceful idle scaling reduces
polling when no work is available. Daemon infrastructure provides persistent
agent processes; proactive task detection and advanced watchdog features are
being hardened for V1.1.

**4-Eyes Mutual Watchdog** — two system agents (IT-Admin + Guide) cross-monitor
ALL agents and each other. If one watchdog misses heartbeats, the other detects
and restarts. If one crashes, the other restarts it. If both crash, systemd
failsafe triggers full restart. Exponential backoff prevents restart loops.
Circuit breaker stops restarts after max crashes and alerts via
Telegram/Discord/Email. No single point of failure.

**Governed Cron Scheduler** — recurring tasks via standard cron expressions.
Per-schedule governance: max cost per run, max runs per day, approval workflows.
DeadlineWatcher: deadline monitoring with configurable warning thresholds.
CLI: `sidjua schedule list/create/enable/disable/delete/show/history`.
REST API: full CRUD at `/api/v1/schedules`. Scheduled cost caps are tracked;
hard enforcement arrives in V1.1.

### Operations

**Single Docker command** to production:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name sidjua \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  -p 4200:4200 \
  -v sidjua-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/goetzkohlberg/sidjua:latest
```

API key is auto-generated on first start — retrieve it with `docker exec sidjua cat /app/.system/api-key`.
No environment variables required. No configuration required. No database
server required — SIDJUA uses SQLite, one database file per agent.

#### Supported Platforms

SIDJUA provides native Docker images for:
- **Intel/AMD** (x86_64) — Linux servers, Windows WSL2, Intel Macs
- **ARM64** (aarch64) — Apple Silicon Macs, AWS Graviton, Raspberry Pi 4+

Use the installer script to automatically detect and load the correct image:
```bash
bash scripts/install-docker.sh 1.0.0
```

#### Error Logging & Privacy

SIDJUA V1.0.0 ships with error logging enabled by default. This helps us identify
and fix issues quickly during the initial release period.

- API keys and secrets are **automatically redacted** and never stored in full
- All logs are stored **locally only** at `/data/logs/sidjua-error.log`
- No data is sent externally without your explicit consent
- User-configurable logging (enable/disable) will be available in V1.0.1
- To disable immediately: `docker run -e SIDJUA_LOG_LEVEL=none ...`

To share logs for support: `docker cp sidjua:/data/logs/sidjua-error.log .`

**CLI Management** — complete lifecycle from a single binary:

```bash
sidjua init                      # Interactive workspace setup (3 steps)
sidjua apply                     # Provision from divisions.yaml
sidjua agent create/list/stop    # Agent lifecycle
sidjua run "task..." --wait      # Submit task with governance enforcement
sidjua audit report              # Compliance report
sidjua costs                     # Cost breakdown by division/agent
sidjua backup create/restore     # HMAC-signed backup management
sidjua update                    # Version update with automatic pre-backup
sidjua rollback                  # 1-click restore to previous version
sidjua email status/test         # Email channel management
sidjua secret set/get/rotate     # Encrypted secrets management
sidjua memory import/search      # Semantic knowledge pipeline
sidjua selftest                  # System health check (7 categories, 0-100 score)
```

**Semantic Memory** — import conversations and documents (`sidjua memory import
~/exports/claude-chats.zip`), search with vector + BM25 hybrid ranking. Supports
Cloudflare Workers AI embeddings (free, zero-config) and OpenAI large embeddings
(higher quality for large knowledge bases).

**Adaptive Chunking** — memory pipeline auto-adjusts chunk sizes to stay within
each embedding model's token limit.

**Zero-Config Guide** — `sidjua chat guide` launches an interactive AI assistant
without any API key, powered by Cloudflare Workers AI through the SIDJUA proxy.
Ask it how to set up agents, configure governance, or understand what happened
in the audit log.

**Air-Gap Deployment** — run fully disconnected from the internet using local
LLMs via Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. No telemetry by default.
Optional opt-in crash reporting with full PII redaction.

### Security

**Sandbox Isolation** — agent skills run inside OS-level process isolation via
bubblewrap (Linux user namespaces). Zero additional RAM overhead. Pluggable
`SandboxProvider` interface: `none` for development, `bubblewrap` for production.

**Secrets Management** — encrypted secrets store with RBAC (`sidjua secret
set/get/list/delete/rotate/namespaces`). No external vault required.

**Security-First Build** — extensive internal testing plus independent validation by 4 external code auditors (DeepSeek V3, xAI Grok, GPT-5.4, Gemini). 10+ audit rounds completed, all findings resolved. Security
headers, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and input sanitization on every API
surface. SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries throughout.

**Backup Integrity** — HMAC-signed backup archives with zip-slip protection,
zip bomb prevention, and manifest checksum verification on restore.

---

## Import from Other Frameworks

```bash
# Preview what gets imported — no changes made
sidjua import openclaw --dry-run

# Import config + skill files
sidjua import openclaw --skills
```

Your existing agents keep their identity, models, and skills. SIDJUA adds
governance, audit trails, and budget controls automatically.

---

### Your Data Is Protected

SIDJUA automatically protects your work — you don't have to think about it.

| What happens | What SIDJUA does | Data loss |
|---|---|---|
| You run `sidjua shutdown` | Drains running tasks, writes checkpoints, stops cleanly | **None** |
| Normal Mac/PC/Linux shutdown | SIDJUA catches the OS shutdown signal and saves automatically | **None** |
| Hard crash, power failure, or force-quit | Silent checkpoints have been saving your state every 60 seconds | **At most 1 minute** |

**How it works:**

SIDJUA detects whether it's running on your laptop or a 24/7 server. On desktops, it silently saves all agent state, chat history, and budget data every 60 seconds — invisible, zero performance impact. On servers (Docker, systemd), every 5 minutes — because servers always receive proper shutdown signals.

When your Mac or PC shuts down normally (menu → Shut Down, or closing the lid with shutdown configured), the operating system sends a termination signal. SIDJUA catches this signal and performs a full graceful shutdown automatically — exactly as if you had run `sidjua shutdown` yourself.

The only scenario where you lose any work is a hard crash: pulling the power cord, a kernel panic, or holding the power button. Even then, the silent checkpoint means you lose at most 60 seconds of in-flight agent work. On restart, SIDJUA automatically recovers — interrupted tasks are flagged, budgets are cleaned up, and your chat history is restored.

**Best practice:** Run `sidjua shutdown` when you're done for the day. But if you forget — SIDJUA has your back.

**For server deployments:** Configure `runtime.mode: server` in your `divisions.yaml` or let SIDJUA auto-detect (systemd/Docker are recognized automatically). Checkpoint interval extends to 5 minutes since servers always receive SIGTERM on shutdown.

---

## Configuration Reference

A minimal `divisions.yaml` to get started:

```yaml
organization:
  name: "my-org"
  tier: 1

divisions:
  - name: operations
    tier: 2
    agents:
      - name: ops-agent
        provider: anthropic
        model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
        division: operations
        budget:
          per_task_usd: 0.25
          per_month_usd: 25.00

governance:
  stage0:
    enabled: true
    forbidden_actions:
      - delete_database
      - exfiltrate_data
    classification:
      default_level: INTERNAL
      max_agent_level: CONFIDENTIAL
```

`sidjua apply` provisions the complete infrastructure from this file. Run it
again after changes — it's idempotent.

See [docs/SIDJUA-APPLY-TECH-SPEC-V1.md](docs/SIDJUA-APPLY-TECH-SPEC-V1.md)
for the full specification of all 10 provisioning steps.

---

## REST API

The SIDJUA REST API runs on the same port as the dashboard:

```bash
sidjua server start --port 4200 --api-key $SIDJUA_API_KEY
```

Key endpoints:

```
GET  /api/v1/health          # Public health check (no auth)
GET  /api/v1/info            # System metadata (authenticated)
POST /api/v1/execute/run     # Submit a task
GET  /api/v1/execute/:id/status  # Task status
GET  /api/v1/execute/:id/result  # Task result
GET  /api/v1/events          # SSE event stream
GET  /api/v1/audit/report    # Compliance report
```

All endpoints except `/health` require Bearer authentication. Generate a key:

```bash
sidjua api-key generate
```

---

## Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  sidjua:
    image: ghcr.io/goetzkohlberg/sidjua:latest
    ports:
      - "4200:4200"
    volumes:
      - sidjua-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  sidjua-data:
```

Or use the included `docker-compose.yml` which adds named volumes for config,
logs, and agent workspace, plus an optional Qdrant service for semantic search:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec sidjua sidjua init
docker compose exec sidjua sidjua apply
```

---

## Providers

SIDJUA connects to any LLM provider without lock-in:

| Provider | Models | API Key |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Anthropic | Claude Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.6 | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google | Gemini 2.0, Gemini 1.5 Pro | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |

| Cloudflare Workers AI | Llama, Mistral, Phi | `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` + `CF_TOKEN` |
| Ollama | Any local model | No key (local) |
| OpenAI-compatible | Any endpoint | Custom URL + key |

```bash
# Add a provider key
sidjua key set groq gsk_...

# List available providers and models
sidjua provider list
```
